# Student Alcohol Consumption Project
*This project was created for the purpose of INFO201 final probject. It explores various characteristics and factors of students alcohol consumption*

## Domain of Interest

### **Why are we interested in this field/domain?**

  Learning more about student alcohol consumption is something all members of the group can benefit from since we are current students ourselves. The benefits of exploring what student alcohol consumption correlates with will allow us to understand the characteristics of the students who drink or do not drink. This information can then be used to help identify who is at a higher risk and thus find where to focus resources in order to protect the safety and health of students.
  
### **What other examples of data driven projects related to this domain?**

1. [Alcohol Consumption and Risky Drinking Patterns among College Students from Selected Countries of the Carpathian Euroregion](https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2018/6084541/)
    
This project looked at the quantity and frequency of alcohol consumption of each respondent. They then analyzed how drinking patterns correlated with gender and with other adverse health behaviors.

2. [Alcohol Consumption among University Students](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267763289_Alcohol_consumption_among_university_students)
    
This project analyzed the alcohol consumption of university students and found that males tended to have higher rates of alcohol consumption, that marital status does not affect alcohol consumption, but in any case, the students tended to drink socially and not on their own.

3. [Performance Analysis of Students Consuming Alcohol](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/313674532_PERFORMANCE_ANALYSIS_OF_STUDENTS_CONSUMING_ALCOHOL_USING_DATA_MINING_TECHNIQUES)
    
        This project assessed how alcohol consumption impacts other health issues, violence, negative academic consequences, STDs, unintended pregnancy, and how it can jeopardize a future job. It analyzed universities separately and aimed to identify which students were in need of assistance, such as advising or counseling.

### **What data-driven questions do we hope to answer about this domain and how?** 
    1. How do relationships (family, friends, and romantic) play a role in a student’s alcohol consumption? 
      
        + We can look at the level of education of the parents, if the parents live together, if the student is in a romantic relationship, how big the student’s family is, if they have a positive relationship with their family, and how much time the student spends with friends.

    2. How does the education of a student relate to alcohol consumption?
      
        + We can look at the student’s grades, how much time they study, if they are receiving financial help with classes, their class attendance, and if they went to preschool when they were younger.

    3. How does the location of a student’s home impact their alcohol consumption?
      
        + We can look at if the student is in an urban or rural area, how long they have to commute to and from school, and whether or not they have access to the internet.

## Finding Data

### **Data sources and description of how the data was collected or generated**

  1. [Student Alcohol Consumption Data Set compiled by UCI Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/student-alcohol-consumption)
  
      Data was generated by a survey of secondary school students, enrolled in portugeuse and math. The survey took place in Portugal and was conducted to predict performance of these students.
  
  2. [Global School-based Student Health Data Set by the CDC](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/dash-global-school-based-student-health-survey-gshs-bf4cd)
  
      Based on a survey created by the World Health Organization, this data set includes global data between 2003 - 2015. It records information that is primarily related to health such as mental health or drug use.
      
  3. [National Health and Nutrition Examination Data Set by the CDC](https://www.kaggle.com/cdc/national-health-and-nutrition-examination-survey)
  
      The data collected by this survey was meant to assess the general health of the United States population. Socioeconomic and demographic information was also recorded.
  
### **Number of observations (rows) and features (columns) in our data**

  1. 396 observations and 33 features
  2. 278,239 observations and 34 features
  3. 1,017,647 observations and 47 features

### **Questions (from above) that can be answered using the data in this dataset**

  1. Because the data set covers a large number of features, we believe it can answer the first and third question well. However since education was kept constant in this dataset, we may need to compare to other data sets.

  2. This dataset includes global data across multiple years, meaning we can answer question 3 on broader terms. We can extrapolate from different features of the dataset to answer question 1, however we will have to make several assumptions. Using age, we can find an answer for question 2 as well.

  3. Although this comes from a pretty broad dataset, we can filter for our targeted age group and fully answer all of the questions we have.
